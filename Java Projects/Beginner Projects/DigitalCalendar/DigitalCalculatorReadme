Program Statement: Digital calendar
A software company wishes to help its employees plan and execute their projects in a better manner. 
The employer intends to have a uniform system that allows the employees to check and fill the progress details of their project.
The company plans to release a digital calendar that will display the days of the month on a screen that looks similar to an analog calendar. 
It will take the day, month and year as input from the user and display it on the calendar.
