Program Statement: Swapping Digits
Develop a program in Java that accepts the integer ‘n’ and performs the following steps:
If the total number of digits in the integer ‘n’ is even, swap the first and second digit, the third and fourth digit, the fifth and sixth digit, and so on.
If the total number of digits in the integer ‘n’ is odd, then the first digit remains unchanged and swapping begins from the second digit.
